In 2019 I graduated cum laude from Penn State University with degrees in Cyber Security^*\ and Information Science^†\. Upon graduation, I accepted a position with the United States Department of Defense as a security analyst, where I have worked since and enjoyed every minute of.

I hold my GIAC Penetration Tester certification and am pursuing a few others at the time of writing. [Find me on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jaredtrigili/) or feel free to send me an email.

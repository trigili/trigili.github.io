I was fortunate enough to be given the opportunity to attend SANS Security East 2017 last month through my school. It was a great experience, and by the end of the course I felt as though I had the ability to conduct a relatively in-depth penetration test. Each day built off of the day prior, so by the fifth of six days I had been taught reconnaissance, scanning, exploitation, etc.. Though a lot of material was covered in a relatively short span of time, the resources included with the course are very helpful when reviewing, and I found that the hands-on labs helped reinforce the concepts.

When taking a SANS course, they (at least in my case) made an offer to take the accompanying GIAC certification exam, in this case the GIAC GPEN, for much less than it would cost without. I opted to purchase the exam, and will be taking it in mid-May. I am confident that the resources provided by SANS will be a great help in studying!
